Developed fundamental architecture of the Employee Management
System by leveraging robust Object-Oriented Programming principles. One of the key accomplishments was establishing a
secure login system, allowing employees exclusive access to the system. This setup enabled the seamless updating of
employee information, thereby maintaining precise and current records. Additionally, I orchestrated a deletion mechanism
that effectively handles employee data removal for instances when they depart from the organization.
